_2.1_  _Enolate formation as rate-determining step_

If C3 enolate formation, (C3H5O – H) _M-O_ is assumed to be the rate-determining step (RDS) [14-16], then, according to transition-state theory, the total rate of reaction can be described by the net rate of reaction for step 2 (S.6):

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    (S.19)

where _r_2 and _r_-2 are the forward and reverse rates of enolate formation, respectively. These rates can be written as the products of their respective barrier crossing coefficients ( ) and transition state concentrations ( ) [17]:

                                                                                                                                                                                                           (S.20)

Equilibrium relations for transition state formation in the forward and reverse reactions, based on microscopic equilibrium, are expressed in terms of thermodynamic activities (_ai_) as:

                                                                                                                                                                                                               (S.21)

                                                                                                                                                                                                    (S.22)

with forward and reverse rate constants:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  (S.23)     

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        (S.24)

Activities can be written as the product of their activity coefficients (𝛾_i_) and molar concentrations (_ci_ for solution phase components, [_L_] for the total number of active sites), normalized by the standard molar concentration (_c0_ = 1 mol m-3). Substituting equations (S.21-24) into equation (S.20) with step 1 (S.5) being quasi-equilibrated   gives the enolate formation rate as:

                                                                                                                             (S.25)

where  is the approach to equilibrium, defined as:

                                                                                                                                                                                (S.26)

                        The following site balance, assuming negligible coverages of intermediates after the RDS, includes vacant Lewis acid-base site pairs ( _M-O_) and C3H6O adsorbed at a M-O site ( ):

                                                                                                                                                                                          (S.27)

which can be expressed in terms of _ai_, 𝛾_i_, and _Ki_ as:

                                                                                         (S.28)

                        Equation (S.28) can be substituted into equation (S.25) and, by assuming that  → 0 at low C3 conversion, can be rewritten as follows to provide the general rate expression for enolate formation:

                                                                                                                               (S.29)

                        For the case where the most abundant reactive intermediate (MARI) is a vacant Lewis acid-base site pair ( _M-O_) at low  activity (i.e., _K_1 ≪ 1), the rate of enolate formation simplifies to the following first-order expression:

                                                                                                                                                                     (S.30)

                        However, if C3H6O adsorbed at a M-O site ( ) becomes the MARI at higher surface coverages (i.e., _K_1 ≫ 1), then the rate of enolate formation will transition to a zero-order regime:

                                                                                                                                                                                     (S.31)

  

_2.2_  _Kinetically relevant C-C coupling step for propanal self-condensation_

By assuming that the kinetically relevant C-C coupling step for C3 self-condensation is nucleophilic attack of the C3 enolate ((C3H5O – H) _M-O_) on a second C3H6O adsorbed at the M-O site ((C3H6O) _M-O_) and all other steps are quasi-equilibrated, the rate expression can be written as:

                                                                                                                              (S.32)

                        The total number of active sites, assuming negligible coverages of intermediates after C-C coupling, can be expressed as follows:

                 (S.33)

which can be expressed in terms of _ai_, 𝛾_i_, and _Ki_ as:

   (S.34)

If enolate formation is assumed to be irreversible (i.e., _r_2 ≫ _r_-2) at low C3 conversion and, according to the pseudo steady state hypothesis (PSSH), the rate of change in bound enolates is zero at the start of the reaction (i.e., initial rates), then:

             (S.35)

                        Under these conditions,  is assumed to be negligible since site normalized C3 conversions (contribution of background reactions subtracted), are < 0.2 and _r_self,_i_ ≫ _r_cross,_i_. Thus,

                                                                                                                                           (S.36)

Substituting equations (S.34) and (S.36) into (S.32) and assuming that  → 0 at low C3 conversion, gives the general form of the C3 self-condensation rate expression:

           (S.37)

                        If vacant M-O site pairs are the MARI at the start of the reaction (i.e., _K_1 ≪ 1), then the simplified rate expression becomes:

                                                                                                                                                                            (S.38)

_2.3_  _Kinetically relevant C-C coupling step for benzaldehyde and propanal cross-condensation_

Like the C3H6O self-condensation pathway, by assuming that the kinetically relevant C-C coupling step for benzaldehyde (C7H6O) and C3H6O cross-condensation is nucleophilic attack of (C3H5O – H) _M-O_ on C7H6O adsorbed at the M-O site ((C7H6O) _M-O_) and all other steps are quasi-equilibrated, the rate expression is written as:

                                                                                                                                 (S.39)

Substituting equations (S.34) and (S.36) into (S.39) and assuming that  → 0 at low C3 conversion, gives the general form of the C3‑C7­ cross-condensation rate expression:

          (S.40)

                        If vacant M-O site pairs are the MARI at the start of the reaction (i.e., _K_1 ≪ 1), then the simplified rate expression becomes:

                                                                                                                                                                      (S.41)
