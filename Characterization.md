## N2 physisorption
The specific surface area and pore size distribution of prepared HBEA were measured by N2-physisorption at -196 °C using Micrometrics ASAP 2020. Prior to N2 adsorption, each sample was degassed at 300 °C for 5 h under vacuum (10−3 mbar). The BET, BJH and t-plot methods were employed to determine the specific surface area, mesopore volume and micropore volume, respectively.
