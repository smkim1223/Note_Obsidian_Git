## N2 physisorption
The specific surface area and pore size distribution of prepared HBEA were measured by N2-physisorption at -196 °C using Micrometrics ASAP 2020. Prior to N2 adsorption, each sample was degassed at 300 °C for 5 h under vacuum (10−3 mbar). The BET, BJH and t-plot methods were employed to determine the specific surface area, mesopore volume and micropore volume, respectively.

## Infrared (IR) spectroscopy
A self-supporting disc of HBEA with a density of approximately 10 mg/cm2 was loaded in the _in situ_ IR cell. The sample disc was evacuated (10-6 mbar) and heated to 450 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and kept for 1 h. Then the sample was cooled to 150 °C for collection of IR spectra. All IR spectra were recorded on a ThermoScientific Nicolete FTIR spectrometer using a MCT detector with a resolution of 4 cm–1 and accumulated for 512 scans. The acid site concentration was determined by IR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on the HBEA sample. After equilibration with pyridine vapors at 0.1 mbar (0.5–1.0 h) at 150 °C, all physisorbed pyridine was outgassed under vacuum (<10-6 mbar). The integral area of the Brønsted (1565–1515 cm-1) and Lewis peaks (1470–1430 cm-1) with the molar extinction coefficients (0.73 cm/μmol and 0.96 cm/μmol for BAS and LAS, respectively) and disc weight were employed for quantification of acid site concentration.
