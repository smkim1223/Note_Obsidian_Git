This research provides **unprecedented quantitative insights into the fundamental interactions governing how molecules with both polar and nonpolar regions behave within zeolite pores**, which are essential materials for catalysis and sorption. The study successfully **deconstructs the complex adsorption process of primary alcohols (C1-C4) in zeolites**, revealing three distinct and quantifiable types of interactions: (i) **alkyl (CHx) groups interact with zeolite pore walls at approximately 10 kJ mol−1 per carbon**, (ii) **alcohol hydroxyl (OH) groups interact with siliceous pore walls at 30−35 kJ mol−1**, and (iii) **alcohol OH groups interact with Brønsted acid sites (BAS) at 37 kJ mol−1**. A significant discovery is that **water's adsorption enthalpy on siliceous zeolite pore walls (33 kJ mol−1) is lower than its condensation enthalpy (45 kJ mol−1)**, explaining why hydrophobic zeolites adsorb only limited concentrations of water, unlike alcohols. This work establishes that **hydrogen bonding of the OH group to the silica wall is notably stronger than the dispersive forces of hydrocarbon groups**, even in "hydrophobic" zeolites.

The challenge of quantitatively disentangling these varied interactions in confined zeolite environments, where both weak dispersion forces and strong hydrogen bonding/Coulomb interactions are at play, was significant. This was overcome by systematically studying primary alcohols of increasing molecular weight, using a powerful combination of **gravimetry and calorimetry experiments with advanced DFT-based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations**. The incremental change in sorption enthalpy with increasing carbon number allowed for the quantification of CHx interactions, while extrapolation provided the OH group's contribution. The **remarkable agreement between experimental and theoretical findings** validated the structural analysis and confirmed the consistency of CHx and OH interactions across different alcohol chain lengths, despite the inherent complexities in computationally modeling BAS interactions.

This research is novel because it offers a **precise, quantitative breakdown of these critical molecular interactions**, providing a **deeper, molecular-level understanding of how zeolite frameworks and acid sites engage with different parts of sorbed molecules**. While it was hypothesized that both nonpolar and polar interactions occur, the clear quantification and the unexpected finding that water's adsorption enthalpy is uniquely lower than its condensation enthalpy—limiting its presence in siliceous pores—are key surprises. This work fundamentally **advances the science of intermolecular forces, surface interactions, and confinement effects** within zeolites. It is critical because a more profound understanding of these interactions is **essential for rationally designing more efficient and selective catalysts** for various industrial applications, including petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and fine chemical industries. By providing this detailed, quantitative foundation, the research directly contributes to optimizing processes, potentially leading to **better and more targeted catalytic outcomes**.

Moving forward, the next crucial step is to **explore how mixtures of water and alcohols partition between zeolite pores and the liquid phase**, which will help define their thermodynamic states under confinement. Further research is also needed to fully understand subtle effects observed computationally, such as the influence of the alkyl chain on the OH group's basicity at the BAS, which was not experimentally evident but might be masked by complex pore confinement effects or conformational changes. This study is part of a broader effort to advance key catalytic reaction steps for carbon neutrality, indicating ongoing research in this vital area.
