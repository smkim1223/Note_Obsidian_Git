### **New Breakthrough in Plastic Recycling: Scientists Develop Low-Temperature Method to Convert PVC and Mixed Waste into Valuable Chemicals and Fuels**

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**[City, State] – [Date]** – Researchers have developed a groundbreaking catalytic process that efficiently transforms challenging plastic waste, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyolefins, into valuable, chlorine-free fuel-range hydrocarbons and hydrochloric acid (HCl) at low temperatures. Published in *Science*, this innovative single-stage approach offers a promising solution to the escalating global plastic waste crisis.

**1. Short Description of Accomplishment**
This research presents a novel strategy for **upcycling discarded PVC and mixed polyolefin waste streams into chlorine-free fuel-range hydrocarbons and HCl** in a single-stage process. The process is catalyzed by **chloroaluminate ionic liquids** and utilizes **light isoalkanes (isobutane or isopentane)** as co-reactants. This method successfully offsets the energy-intensive (endothermic) dechlorination and carbon-carbon (C-C) bond cleavage steps with energy-releasing (exothermic) alkylation and hydrogen transfer reactions in a low-temperature tandem process.

**2. Result Summary**
The new process achieved **100% polymer conversion in just 30 minutes** when processing commercial PVC with either isobutane (iC4) or isopentane (iC5). The products were predominantly **saturated, chlorine-free liquid hydrocarbons**, with approximately 55-61 wt.% falling within the gasoline range (C6-C12 isoalkanes). For instance, PVC processing with iC5 yielded about 55 wt.% C6-C12 isoalkanes and 40 wt.% iC4. When using iC4, 94 wt.% isoalkanes were produced, including 33 wt.% iC5 and 61 wt.% C6-C12. Importantly, the process **recovered most of the chlorine in PVC as HCl (~61% to ~80%)**, with the remaining bound within the ionic liquid (~35%).

This method is highly effective for **real-world mixed and contaminated PVC and polyolefin waste streams**. Experiments with post-consumer PVC waste, including soft and rigid pipes and wires, demonstrated comparable reactivity at room temperature (30°C). Mixed waste batches, including PVC and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, also showed nearly quantitative solid conversion, primarily producing iC4. The gaseous iC4 product can be recycled as an alkylating component, along with unreacted iC5, highlighting the process's efficiency and sustainability.

**3. Challenges and Overcoming Them**
The recycling of PVC and mixed plastic waste streams faces significant technical and economic challenges.

*   **Environmental Concerns of PVC:** PVC contains a high chlorine content (~57 wt.%), which poses severe environmental issues, especially during traditional waste-to-energy methods like incineration, due to the release of toxic chlorinated compounds such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls. PVC's flame-retardant properties also hinder energy recovery efficiency, leading a substantial portion to landfills.
*   **Dechlorination Complexity:** Traditional chemical upcycling methods for PVC require thorough, high-temperature dechlorination to prevent catalyst poisoning by HCl or chlorine-containing compounds, leading to complex operation, reduced efficiency, and increased energy consumption.
*   **Thermodynamic Limitations:** PVC's inherently lower hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio compared to polyolefins requires substantial hydrogen addition or redistribution. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that dehydrochlorination and C-C cleavage alone are significantly restricted by equilibrium constraints at low temperatures. Without sufficient hydrogen input, previous approaches yielded undesirable byproducts like "acid-soluble oil" (ASO), which deactivates catalysts.

The researchers **overcame these challenges** by:
*   Developing a **single-stage, low-temperature catalytic tandem process**. This novel approach **integrates endothermic dechlorination and C-C bond cleavage with exothermic alkylation** using light isoalkanes (iC4/iC5). This strategic coupling ensures both kinetic and thermodynamic efficiency, minimizing energy requirements and optimizing conversion thermodynamics.
*   Utilizing **AlCl3-based chloroaluminate ionic liquids** as catalysts, which facilitate the reaction at mild conditions.
*   Employing **light isoalkanes (isobutane and isopentane)**, which are readily available from refinery processes, to address the low H/C ratio of PVC by facilitating hydrogen transfer and forming C-C bonds through alkylation. This also suppresses the formation of undesirable unsaturated compounds like ASO.
*   Discovering that **PVC itself acts as a carbenium ion initiator**. This eliminates the need for external initiators like tert-butyl chloride (TBC), which are typically required for polyolefin deconstruction. Co-processing PVC with polyolefins significantly improves the conversion rates of polyolefins by generating carbenium ions through PVC dechlorination, which then activate polyolefin chains.

**4. Impact: What Problem is Being Solved? Is it a New Approach?**
This research solves the critical problem of **managing PVC plastic waste**, which poses severe environmental challenges due to its recalcitrance and the toxic byproducts of traditional disposal methods. It provides a **sustainable and efficient pathway** to divert PVC from landfills and incineration, transforming it into valuable resources.

This is indeed a **new and transformative approach**:
*   It's the **first low-temperature, single-stage catalytic process** that simultaneously dehydrochlorinates PVC and breaks C-C bonds while coupling these endothermic reactions with exothermic alkylation and hydrogen transfer.
*   The use of **PVC as an in-situ carbenium ion initiator** for polyolefin deconstruction is a unique finding that enhances the efficiency of co-processing mixed plastic waste without external initiators.
*   The process ensures the **preservation of all carbon atoms** in the chlorine-free end products, aligning with refinery operations for efficient joint upcycling of PVC, polyolefins, and isoalkanes.

**5. Why It Matters: Importance and Advancement of Science**
This research is of paramount importance because it addresses a major environmental and economic challenge:
*   **Environmental Stewardship:** It offers a robust solution to a significant portion of global plastic waste streams, reducing reliance on landfills and preventing the release of highly toxic chlorinated compounds during disposal.
*   **Resource Valorization:** Instead of waste, PVC is converted into valuable, chlorine-free liquid hydrocarbons that can be used as fuels, and a critical industrial raw material, HCl, is recovered. HCl is a raw material for new PVC synthesis, metal processing, water treatment, and pharmaceuticals, among other applications, and is typically produced through energy-intensive processes.
*   **Economic Efficiency:** By operating at low temperatures (30-80°C) and ambient pressure in a single stage, the process significantly reduces energy consumption, equipment needs, and intermediate steps, leading to substantial cost savings. This makes it a **better, faster, and potentially cheaper** alternative to existing methods.
*   **Advancing Circular Economy:** The method supports a circular economy by converting diverse plastic waste into valuable products in a single step, improving product quality and facilitating scalability for industrial applications. It also tackles the heterogeneity and impurities found in real-world plastic mixtures, which often complicate recycling efforts.

**6. What's Next?**
While this study successfully demonstrates a proof-of-concept for the catalytic tandem process, the researchers recognize the need for further exploration:
*   **Impact of Additives and Impurities:** The current studies deliberately sidelined the complexities introduced by feedstock purity to focus on the core demonstration. The potential specific impact of various additives and impurities typically found in mixed real-world polymers on the ionic liquid catalyst needs to be addressed separately.
*   **Process Optimization for Industrial Scale:** Further research will focus on optimizing the process for industrial scalability, ensuring its robustness and efficiency in larger-scale applications.
*   **Broader Research Initiative:** This research is part of a larger, ongoing effort to tackle plastic waste valorization. The authors acknowledge funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), under projects such as "Towards a Polyolefin-Based Refinery: Understanding and Controlling the Critical Reaction Steps" and "Advancing Key Catalytic Reaction Steps for Achieving Carbon Neutrality" [Acknowledgments]. This indicates that further research is already in progress as part of a comprehensive strategy to develop sustainable solutions for plastic waste.
