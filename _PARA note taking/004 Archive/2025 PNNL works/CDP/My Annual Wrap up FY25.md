## Q1 What worked well this year? (This can include accomplishments, milestones, and achievements.)
This is the first year that I have involved in project management as a project deputy for EFRC, BES, and industrial projects. It provided me with a valuable opportunity to gain a broader perspective on these projects. Moreover, I have attended a pilot program of PCSD Leadership Cohort in FY24, which gave me lots of opportunities to meet with senior scientists and managers in the different directorates and DOE managers, as well as helped me to get an idea about PNNL structure and how we work with the sponsors.  
  
From the team managing point of view, I have had lots of supports from Janos and Huamin to move the projects smoothly and on the right direction. Besides, I was able to have good communication with the team members (PhD students and postdoctoral researchers) for their research work and following up their progress. This makes me with them to have several publications in this FY.  
  
Lastly, I had participated in BES renewal proposal as a Co-PI and prepared one of Subtask in the proposal with other Co-PIs throughout FY24. It was a great experience to me for looking into our BES proposal structure in more detail, and gave me an opportunity how we can consider for making BES program move forward.
