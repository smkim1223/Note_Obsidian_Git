## Q1 What worked well this year? (This can include accomplishments, milestones, and achievements.)
This is the first year that I have involved in project management as a project deputy for EFRC, BES, and industrial projects. It provided me with a valuable opportunity to gain a broader perspective on these projects. Moreover, I have attended a pilot program of PCSD Leadership Cohort in FY24, which gave me lots of opportunities to meet with senior scientists and managers in the different directorates and DOE managers, as well as helped me to get an idea about PNNL structure and how we work with the sponsors.  
  
From the team managing point of view, I have had lots of supports from Janos and Huamin to move the projects smoothly and on the right direction. Besides, I was able to have good communication with the team members (PhD students and postdoctoral researchers) for their research work and following up their progress. This makes me with them to have several publications in this FY.  
  
Lastly, I had participated in BES renewal proposal as a Co-PI and prepared one of Subtask in the proposal with other Co-PIs throughout FY24. It was a great experience to me for looking into our BES proposal structure in more detail, and gave me an opportunity how we can consider for making BES program move forward.

- Janos' reply: You had a very transformational year in many ways. After Oliver`s departure you were tasked to manage a number of projects and also mentor several students and PDs. In the meantime you had to be involved in preparing the Catalysis BES program renewal. A lot to ask in a very short period of time. And you did a great job. Now that you became familiar with this new position you should focus on the science that is conducted under your mentorship with guidance from Johannes and Huamin

## Q2 What didn’t work well this year? (This can include challenges, missed opportunities, and areas to be addressed or improvement needed.)
Due to an incidental lack of the craft workforce and initiating a new project for Chevron for CO2 hydrogenation, we faced challenges at the beginning by building up a new high-pressure fixed bed reactor, extending our lab activity scope in the lab assist, and instrumental problems.  
  
In FY24, researchers and I have struggled to maintain Calorimetry (Sensys Evo TGA/DSC) due to the leaking, and building up temperature-programmed desorption instruments. Calorimetry meets the operation specification from the vendor. However, the leaking on the furnace has not been sorted out. Now, we have collected the parts for TPD, thus, are looking forward to building up the instrument soon.  
  
We are still challenging to get the approval for starting Total energy project for polymer conversion, from March 2023 when the sponsor secured the funds. We are waiting for the DOE about the agreement. This is very important to manage the research budget in the upcoming FY25 due to the running low budget of BES and BASF polymer projects.

- Janos' reply: Most of these issues are out of your control and were not due to lack of your effort. Unfortunately we had shortage on technical support (delay in reactor setup) and administrative responsiveness (contract approval).

## Q3 **Describe the status/progress on fiscal year goals.** (Describe how the fiscal year goals were accomplished and/or how you adapted goals due to changing priorities.)
I have involved the projects in both applied and fundamental research area with BES catalysis, BES polymer, BASF polymer, Chevron CO2 hydrogenation, and CD4DC. Even though I had a couple of challenges described in the question #2, all the goals set for FY 24 in the last CDP was successfully achieved including publications, BES renewal and initiating CO2 hydrogenation projects. With thanks to team efforts on the projects, we were able to continue the projects of Chevron CO2 hydrogenation and CD4DC.  
  
Besides, I also had an opportunity to host visiting researchers of Mirek, William and David, which allowed me to collaborate with their advisors and keep the relationship in heterogeneous catalysis communities.

- Janos' reply: You are positioned very well to complete all the tasks/goals set for you. Great job with hosting and helping visitors!

## Q4 **What could be amazing in the new FY?** (List new opportunities on the horizon or areas of continued focus related to goals and career development. This can include barriers that management can remove, assistance the manager can provide, areas of development that would be of benefit, etc.)
I have accepted a couple of invited talk in 9th International Conference on  
Catalysis and Chemical Engineering (CCE-2025) and ACS Spring 2025. So, in the upcoming FY25, I will try to contribute into catalysis division and enhance my visibility.  
  
The polymer conversion team is working on several manuscripts in upcoming FY25 including PVC depolymerization, disproportionation and hydrogenolysis. We will find out the funding opportunities with those achievement and look forward to a positive response from DOE for the polymer projects. Besides, we are also looking forward to initiate Total energy project for the polymer conversion.  
  
The team is discussing with a sponsor, BASF to extend or replace the scope beyond polymer conversion including biomass conversion.  
  
All the upcoming projects are important to continue our research work on polymer conversion and keep our workforce in heterogeneous catalysis research.

- Janos' reply: Invitations to conferences are essential to your career in light of increased external recognition and visibility.  In order to have a chance for renewing the polymer proposal from DOE it is critical that papers are published. Need to really focus on pushing these out.
