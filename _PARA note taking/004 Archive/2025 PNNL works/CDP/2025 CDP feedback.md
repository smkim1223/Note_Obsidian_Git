# Udishnu 2025
## Feedback will be sent directly to the line manager(s). To better inform the line manager, would you like to define your association to the person (e.g., peer, project manager, external feedback provider information, etc.)?
I work with him in the Basic Energy Science program at PCSD, so my association with him is as a project peer and collaborator within the same research program. In addition, Udishnu and I have discussed topics related to thermal and electrochemical catalysis for a couple of projects, further expanding our collaborative interactions in these research areas.

## Did they make a significant contribution, demonstrate leadership, or other behavior(s) that positively impacted the team, work/project, or collaboration?
He consistently brings valuable insights to discussions, in particular, electrocatalysis project in BES program. His leadership and proactive engagement with his technical expertise and collaborative approaches have positively impacted on our projects.

## Are there opportunities for improvement (e.g., related to their work, technical or behavioral competencies, collaboration, etc.)?
I also look forward to increasing his contributions to fundamental research works with high long-term potential. Strengthening this aspect would not only enhance the group’s research portfolio but also support his own professional growth in a meaningful way.



# Oceane 2025
## Feedback will be sent directly to the line manager(s). To better inform the line manager, would you like to define your association to the person (e.g., peer, project manager, external feedback provider information, etc.)?
I have worked with Ocean since we collaborated on a proposal during the FY 2025 LDRD Team Building Workshop: Cross-Division Seed Call. Our proposal was successfully funded under LDRD 86088, _Virtual Intelligence System for Optimizing Novel Analytical Research Yields_. Together, we have been developing a hypothesis generation model aimed at advancing catalyst development, with her and I serving as Co-PIs, contributing domain expertise and data science, respectively. My professional relationship with her has been as a project peer and collaborator within the same research program.

## Did they make a significant contribution, demonstrate leadership, or other behavior(s) that positively impacted the team, work/project, or collaboration?
As the Principal Investigator, she has effectively led the project in the right direction and has managed it with a proactive and strategic approach. She consistently contributes valuable insights during discussions, particularly in bridging the gap between domain knowledge and data science. Her leadership, technical expertise, and collaborative mindset have had a positive and meaningful impact on the success of our project.

## Are there opportunities for improvement (e.g., related to their work, technical or behavioral competencies, collaboration, etc.)?
She has demonstrated strong leadership in the project and showcased her expertise in data science. As collaboration between domain science and data science becomes increasingly important, in particular, with the lab’s growing emphasis on autonomous science. I look forward to seeing her further expand her understanding of experimental science, including its language and workflows. Strengthening this area will not only help bridge the gap between disciplines but will also enhance our group’s research portfolio and contribute meaningfully to her own professional development.

# Huamin 2025
## Feedback will be sent directly to the line manager(s). To better inform the line manager, would you like to define your association to the person (e.g., peer, project manager, external feedback provider information, etc.)?
I am a research colleague and collaborator and has worked closely with him for the past year on the Basic Energy Sciences (BES) program for catalysis. Besides, our collaboration spans multiple fundamental research projects in heterogeneous catalysis, including: (ii) BES polymer research, and (ii) CD4DC,  Metal-Organic Framework (MOF)-based hydrogenation studies. So, I would provide my insight on his technical capability and leadership approach with close working relationship.

## Did they make a significant contribution, demonstrate leadership, or other behavior(s) that positively impacted the team, work/project, or collaboration?
He consistently demonstrates exceptional technical expertise and effective leadership across our catalysis projects, with particular strength in both fundamental heterogeneous catalysis and applied catalysis. His ability to provide insightful scientific perspectives during discussions has greatly enhanced the quality and impact of our work. Over the past year, through our collaboration in the projects, he has also played a key role in my own professional growth. His unique ability to bridge fundamental science with applied research has not only strengthened our team’s overall effectiveness but also contributed substantially to the success of our projects.

## Are there opportunities for improvement (e.g., related to their work, technical or behavioral competencies, collaboration, etc.)?
I also look forward to increasing his contributions to fundamental research works with high long-term potential. Strengthening this aspect would not only enhance the group’s research portfolio but also support his own professional growth in a meaningful way. 

He has been requested to be involved in the fundamental studies along with his major approaches in the applied science. By considering his capability, I believe he can enhance his research and manage scope across the basic and applied science.
