# **Research Proposal: Catalyst Development for Li-CO₂ Batteries**

## **Introduction**

Lithium-carbon dioxide (Li-CO₂) batteries represent a promising platform for energy storage and CO₂ utilization, combining environmental and energy benefits. These batteries operate by electrochemically converting CO₂ into lithium carbonate (Li₂CO₃) and carbon, storing energy in the process. However, several challenges remain, including slow reaction kinetics, high overpotential during discharge, poor cyclability, and side reactions that degrade performance.

Advanced catalysts play a critical role in overcoming these limitations. Efficient catalysts can lower reaction overpotential, facilitate CO₂ reduction, optimize product formation, and improve the battery's cycle life. This proposal explores strategies for designing, synthesizing, and evaluating catalysts tailored for Li-CO₂ battery applications, enabling next-generation energy systems.

## **Objective**

The primary objective is to develop novel catalysts for Li-CO₂ batteries that:
1. Enhance reaction kinetics during both discharge (CO₂ reduction) and charge (Li₂CO₃/carbon oxidation).
2. Minimize overpotentials and improve energy efficiency.
3. Boost battery cyclability, durability, and overall performance.

The aim is to design catalysts rooted in nanotechnology and material science that address the challenges of selectivity, stability, and recyclability for Li-CO₂ battery systems.

## **Hypothesis**

Tailored catalyst materials with high conductivity, optimized surface area, and carefully designed active sites will facilitate:
1. **Selective CO₂ reduction** during battery discharge to produce desired products (Li₂CO₃ and solid carbon) more efficiently.
2. **Efficient oxidation** of these discharge products during charging, reducing overpotential and prolonging battery life.

The synergy between catalyst composition, nanostructure, and functionality is the key to overcoming kinetic and thermodynamic barriers.
