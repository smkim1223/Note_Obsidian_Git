**Carbon-supported Brønsted acid catalysts** are a class of heterogeneous catalysts where **Brønsted acid sites** are anchored onto carbon-based materials such as activated carbon, carbon spheres, or amorphous carbon. These catalysts combine the advantages of strong acid functionality with the high surface area, tunable porosity, and chemical stability of carbon supports.

**Key Features and Preparation:**
- **Brønsted acid sites** can be introduced onto carbon materials through various functionalization methods, such as sulfonation (adding SO₃H groups) or phosphonation (adding phosphonate groups)[7][6].
- For example, **phosphonate-functionalized carbon spheres** are synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization of sugars followed by treatment with phosphorus reagents, generating surface Brønsted acidity suitable for catalytic applications[6].
- **Sulfonated amorphous carbon** (bearing SO₃H groups) acts as a solid Brønsted acid catalyst and is effective for a variety of acid-catalyzed organic transformations[7].

**Catalytic Applications:**
- These catalysts are used in processes such as **acetylene dimerization**, **isomerization of epoxides**, **esterification**, and **biomass valorization**[2][5][6][7].
- For instance, an **activated carbon-supported Brønsted acid catalyst** demonstrated superior performance in acetylene dimerization due to optimized acid site density and enhanced dispersion of active components[2][5].
- **Phosphonate-functionalized carbon spheres** have been shown to catalyze the isomerization of α-pinene oxide with high conversion and selectivity, and good recyclability[6].
- **SO₃H-functionalized carbon materials** are highlighted for their versatility and sustainability in diverse organic transformations, including biodiesel synthesis and carbohydrate conversion[7].

**Advantages:**
- **Heterogeneous nature** allows for easy separation and reuse, reducing waste and process costs compared to traditional homogeneous acids like H₂SO₄ or HCl[7].
- **Tunable acidity** and **abundant functional groups** on the carbon support enable customization for specific reactions[2][5].
- Enhanced **catalytic performance** is often linked to the optimized distribution of acid sites and improved conductivity of the carbon material[2][5].

**Recent Developments:**
- Research is ongoing to design **bifunctional carbon-based catalysts** that combine both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, offering even greater versatility for complex transformations such as biomass conversion to platform chemicals[3][4].

In summary, **carbon-supported Brønsted acid catalysts** represent a robust, tunable, and sustainable platform for acid-catalyzed reactions, with demonstrated effectiveness in various industrial and green chemistry applications[2][5][6][7].
