# Hypothesis for a Novel MOF for CO2 Capture and Conversion

  ## Proposed MOF Design: Zr-TCPP-BPY-Cu

  ### Components:

  **Nodes:**
- Zr6O4(OH)4 clusters (hexanuclear zirconium-oxo clusters)
**Linkers:**
- Primary: TCPP (tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin)
- Secondary: BPY (4,4'-bipyridine) as pillaring ligand
- Post-synthetic modification: Cu(II) metalation of porphyrin centers
### Synthesis Conditions:
**Temperature:** 120°C for solvothermal synthesis
**Pressure:** Autogenous pressure in sealed vessel (approximately 2-3 bar)
**Solvent:** DMF/Formic acid mixture (5:1 v/v)

**Pre-treatments:**
- Sonication of linker mixture for 30 minutes
- Addition of benzoic acid as modulator (3 equivalents)

**Post-treatments:**
- Solvent exchange with acetone (3× over 72 hours)
- Activation under vacuum at 150°C for 12 hours
- Cu(II) metalation using Cu(NO3)2 in DMF at 85°C for 24 hours
- Final activation under vacuum at 120°C for 8 hours
### Predicted Molecular Structure:
- 3D framework with Zr6 nodes connected by TCPP linkers in a UiO-type topology
- BPY ligands act as pillars between 2D sheets
- Cu(II) ions coordinated to the porphyrin centers
- Expected surface area: 2200-2500 m²/g
- Predicted pore size: hierarchical porosity with micropores (~1.0 nm) and mesopores (~2.5 nm)
- Anticipated framework stability: thermal stability up to 350°C, chemical stability in pH range 3-10
### Rationale:
This MOF combines the exceptional stability of Zr-based nodes with the catalytic potential of metalloporphyrins. The pillared structure should create accessible active sites for CO2 capture, while the Cu(II) centers can facilitate CO2 conversion to value-added products. The hierarchical porosity should enhance mass transport while maintaining high surface area for adsorption.

### Expected Applications:
- Selective CO2 capture from flue gas streams
- Photocatalytic or electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO or methanol
- Potential for sensing applications based on the optical properties of the metalloporphyrin units
