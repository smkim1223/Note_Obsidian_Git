# CO2 Conversion to Dimethyl and Diethyl Carbonate: Direct and Indirect Synthetic Pathways for Sustainable Chemical Production

## Introduction

The escalating atmospheric CO2 concentrations, currently exceeding 420 ppm, present both an environmental challenge and a significant chemical feedstock opportunity[1]. Carbon dioxide, despite its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness, represents a renewable C1 building block that can be transformed into valuable organic carbonates through catalytic processes[2]. Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) are particularly attractive target molecules due to their expanding applications as green solvents, battery electrolytes, and chemical intermediates[3][4].

DMC serves as a **non-toxic methylating agent** and **high-performance electrolyte solvent** for lithium-ion batteries, with the global electrolyte solvent DMC market projected to reach **USD 4.2 billion by 2035**, growing at a **CAGR of 8.8%**[4]. DEC functions as an **aprotic, biodegradable solvent** with applications spanning electronics, pharmaceuticals, and coatings industries[5][6]. Both carbonates offer significant advantages over traditional phosgene-based synthesis routes, eliminating the use of toxic reagents while utilizing waste CO2 as a carbon source[7][8].

The conversion of CO2 into organic carbonates represents a critical component of the **circular carbon economy**, where captured carbon is recycled into valuable products rather than sequestered[9]. This approach addresses dual objectives: **CO2 utilization for climate change mitigation** and **sustainable chemical production** from renewable feedstocks[10].
