## Introduction

The formation of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds represents one of the most fundamental and economically significant transformations in organic synthesis, serving as the cornerstone for constructing complex molecular architectures from simple building blocks. Among the diverse array of C-C bond-forming reactions, aldol condensation occupies a position of paramount importance due to its versatility, atom economy, and widespread industrial applications. This reaction enables the strategic assembly of carbonyl compounds through enolate chemistry, simultaneously creating new C-C bonds while introducing functional group diversity that is essential for downstream chemical transformations.

### Impact and Significance of C-C Coupling Reactions and Aldol Condensation

The industrial significance of aldol condensation reactions extends far beyond academic interest, representing a multi-billion-dollar segment of the global chemical industry. These transformations are particularly crucial in the production of high-value chemical intermediates from readily available feedstocks, with acetone serving as an archetypal substrate due to its abundance, low cost, and favorable reactivity profile. The self-condensation of acetone yields a cascade of valuable products, including diacetone alcohol, mesityl oxide, and isophorone, which serve as essential building blocks in the manufacture of solvents, polymers, pharmaceuticals, and fine chemicals.

Mesityl oxide, the primary dehydration product of acetone aldol condensation, represents a particularly important industrial intermediate with annual global production exceeding 200,000 metric tons. This α,β-unsaturated ketone serves as a precursor to methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), a widely used solvent in the coatings industry, and isophorone, a key monomer for specialty polyamides and polyurethanes. The economic value proposition of these transformations is compelling: converting acetone (≈$1,200/ton) to mesityl oxide (≈$2,800/ton) or isophorone (≈$4,500/ton) represents significant value addition through relatively straightforward chemical processing.

Beyond direct economic considerations, efficient aldol condensation processes contribute substantially to environmental sustainability by enabling more selective and atom-economical synthetic routes. Traditional approaches often rely on stoichiometric reagents and generate substantial waste streams, whereas well-designed catalytic systems can achieve high selectivity with minimal byproduct formation. The development of robust, selective catalysts for these transformations directly supports green chemistry principles by reducing raw material consumption, minimizing waste generation, and enabling process intensification.

Current challenges in selective aldol condensation center on controlling reaction selectivity and preventing catalyst deactivation. The inherent reactivity of aldol products toward further condensation, cyclization, and polymerization reactions creates complex product distributions that complicate separation and purification processes. Additionally, the basic conditions traditionally employed for aldol reactions are incompatible with acid-sensitive substrates and prone to side reactions that compromise yields and selectivity. These limitations have driven extensive research toward the development of improved catalytic systems capable of achieving high selectivity under mild conditions.

### Brønsted Acid Catalysts in C-C Coupling and Aldol Condensation

The historical development of acid-catalyzed aldol condensation dates back to the early 20th century, when researchers first recognized that proton acids could effectively promote these transformations under conditions that avoid the harsh basic environments typically required. This discovery opened new synthetic possibilities and enabled aldol condensation of substrates that are unstable under basic conditions. However, the widespread adoption of homogeneous acid catalysts has been limited by challenges related to product separation, catalyst recovery, and environmental concerns associated with strong mineral acids.

The emergence of heterogeneous Brønsted acid catalysts, particularly crystalline microporous aluminosilicates (zeolites), has revolutionized the field by addressing many limitations of homogeneous systems. Zeolite H-BEA (hydrogen form of beta zeolite) has emerged as a particularly promising catalyst for aldol condensation reactions due to its unique combination of strong Brønsted acidity, thermal stability, and three-dimensional pore architecture. The beta zeolite framework features intersecting 12-membered ring channels with dimensions of approximately 0.76 × 0.64 nm and 0.55 × 0.55 nm, providing sufficient space to accommodate organic substrates while imposing shape selectivity constraints that can enhance reaction selectivity.

The Brønsted acid sites in H-BEA zeolite arise from framework aluminum atoms that create charge imbalance compensated by protons, generating acidic bridging hydroxyl groups (Si-OH-Al) with acid strength comparable to concentrated sulfuric acid. These sites exhibit remarkable thermal stability and can be precisely controlled through synthesis and post-synthesis treatments, enabling fine-tuning of catalytic properties. Recent mechanistic studies have revealed that acetone condensation over Brønsted acid sites proceeds through a well-defined pathway involving initial hydrogen bonding of acetone to the acidic proton, followed by nucleophilic attack of a second acetone molecule to form the C-C bond in the rate-determining step.

Previous investigations of zeolite catalysts for acetone condensation have primarily focused on gas-phase reactions or utilized simple protic solvents, providing valuable insights into intrinsic catalytic behavior but offering limited understanding of how complex liquid-phase environments influence reaction outcomes. Studies by Iglesia and coworkers demonstrated that acetone condensation rates over various zeolite frameworks correlate with the ability of micropores to stabilize the bimolecular transition state through van der Waals interactions, highlighting the importance of geometric constraints in determining catalytic activity. However, these studies were conducted under conditions that may not fully represent industrial liquid-phase operations.

Comparative studies with other catalyst systems have revealed both advantages and limitations of Brønsted acid zeolites. Lewis acid catalysts, such as those based on Sn-BEA or Ti-BEA, can achieve high selectivity for certain aldol reactions but often suffer from limited hydrothermal stability and sensitivity to water. Base catalysts, including metal oxides and supported amines, provide high activity for aldol condensation but typically exhibit poor selectivity and rapid deactivation. The unique combination of high activity, selectivity, and stability exhibited by Brønsted acid zeolites positions them as preferred catalysts for industrial applications.

Catalyst deactivation remains a persistent challenge in aldol condensation reactions, typically resulting from the formation of higher molecular weight condensation products that strongly adsorb on active sites or block micropores. Recent advances in understanding deactivation mechanisms have revealed that strategic introduction of hydrogenation functionality can significantly extend catalyst lifetime by converting reactive α,β-unsaturated products to more stable saturated analogs, thereby preventing sequential condensation reactions that lead to coke formation.

### Molecular Environment and Solvent Effects in Liquid-Phase Catalysis

The recognition that molecular-level interactions within confined spaces can dramatically influence catalytic behavior has emerged as one of the most important paradigms in modern heterogeneous catalysis. Unlike gas-phase reactions where substrate-catalyst interactions dominate, liquid-phase processes involve complex three-body interactions between substrates, catalysts, and solvent molecules that can significantly modulate reaction energetics and selectivity. Understanding and controlling these interactions represents a frontier challenge with substantial implications for catalyst design and process optimization.

The role of solvent in modulating catalyst-substrate interactions extends far beyond simple medium effects, encompassing changes in acid strength, active site accessibility, and transition state stabilization. In zeolite-catalyzed reactions, solvents can alter the effective acid strength of Brønsted sites through hydrogen bonding interactions, modify the local dielectric environment within micropores, and compete with substrates for adsorption sites. These effects are particularly pronounced in microporous catalysts where the confined geometry amplifies solvent-framework interactions.

Micropore environment effects on reaction kinetics and selectivity arise from the unique ability of molecular-sized pores to discriminate between different molecular species based on size, shape, and chemical properties. Recent computational and experimental studies have revealed that the stabilization of transition states within zeolite micropores depends critically on the "fit" between the reacting species and the pore dimensions, with optimal activity achieved when transition states are preferentially stabilized relative to ground state reactants. This geometric selectivity can be further modulated by solvent effects that alter the effective size and polarity of reacting species.

Solvent polarity represents a key parameter that influences both Brønsted acid strength and site accessibility in zeolite catalysts. Polar solvents such as water can significantly enhance the apparent acid strength of bridging hydroxyl groups through stabilization of ion-pair intermediates, while simultaneously competing for adsorption sites and potentially blocking access to micropores. Non-polar solvents like decalin exhibit minimal competition for active sites but may fail to provide adequate solvation of polar transition states, leading to different selectivity patterns and reaction rates.

The contrast between water and decalin as reaction media for zeolite-catalyzed aldol condensation is particularly intriguing from both fundamental and practical perspectives. Water represents an extreme case of polar, hydrogen-bonding solvent that can form complex networks within zeolite micropores and dramatically alter the local chemical environment. Recent studies have revealed that water molecules in zeolite pores adopt unique structures different from bulk water, with implications for catalytic activity that are only beginning to be understood. Conversely, decalin represents a non-polar, hydrophobic environment that minimizes specific solvent-catalyst interactions while providing a medium that may enhance the effective concentration of organic substrates within micropores.

Solvation effects on transition state stabilization represent a critical but poorly understood aspect of liquid-phase catalysis in microporous materials. The confined geometry of zeolite micropores creates unique solvation environments that differ substantially from bulk solution behavior, potentially leading to altered reaction selectivity and kinetics. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the reorganization of solvent structures during reaction can contribute significantly to activation barriers, with implications for rational catalyst design that have yet to be fully explored experimentally.

Despite significant advances in understanding individual aspects of liquid-phase catalysis in microporous materials, substantial gaps remain in our fundamental knowledge of how different solvents influence molecular interactions within zeolite micropores and subsequently affect reaction outcomes. Most previous studies have examined either gas-phase reactions or utilized simple alcohols as solvents, providing limited insight into the behavior of complex solvent systems or the fundamental principles governing solvent selection for optimal catalytic performance.

### Research Objectives and Approach

This research addresses the critical knowledge gap regarding solvent effects in liquid-phase aldol condensation over Brønsted acid zeolites by systematically investigating acetone self-condensation in two fundamentally different solvent environments: water (polar, hydrogen-bonding) and decalin (non-polar, hydrophobic). Through careful comparison of reaction kinetics, product selectivity, and catalyst stability in these contrasting media, this study aims to elucidate the fundamental principles governing solvent-catalyst-substrate interactions in microporous environments and provide rational guidelines for solvent selection in liquid-phase catalytic processes.

The insights gained from this investigation will contribute to both fundamental understanding of liquid-phase catalysis in confined environments and practical development of improved processes for acetone upgrading and related C-C bond-forming reactions. By establishing structure-activity relationships that account for solvent effects, this work will advance the rational design of liquid-phase catalytic systems and contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable chemical processes.

### Manuscript Introduction: Acetone Self-Aldol Condensation in Liquid Phase

#### **1. Impact and Significance of C-C Coupling Reactions and Aldol Condensation**

Carbon-carbon (C-C) bond formation is a cornerstone of industrial organic synthesis, providing the fundamental framework for constructing complex organic molecules from simpler precursors. These reactions are indispensable in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials. Among the diverse strategies for C-C bond formation, aldol condensation stands out as a particularly powerful and versatile reaction. It facilitates the creation of β-hydroxy aldehydes or β-hydroxy ketones, which serve as crucial intermediates in the synthesis of numerous valuable products.

The economic significance of aldol condensation is prominently highlighted by the conversion of acetone, a bulk chemical, into higher-value products such as mesityl oxide and isophorone. These derivatives are extensively used as industrial solvents, plasticizers, and precursors for perfumes and pharmaceuticals. In the petrochemical and fine chemical industries, aldol condensation products are foundational building blocks for a multitude of chemical processes. Moreover, in the pharmaceutical sector, this reaction is integral to the synthesis of complex drug molecules, including statins and various active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

Developing efficient C-C coupling processes carries significant environmental benefits. Catalytic routes that offer high selectivity and yield minimize the formation of unwanted byproducts, leading to more sustainable and atom-economical chemical manufacturing. Despite its widespread application, achieving high selectivity in aldol condensation reactions remains a considerable challenge. Issues such as self-condensation of different reactants in crossed aldol reactions and controlling the reaction to prevent unwanted side reactions are active areas of research.

#### **2. Brønsted Acid Catalysts in C-C Coupling and Aldol Condensation**

Historically, aldol condensation has been catalyzed by both acids and bases. While base-catalyzed routes are common, acid catalysis offers distinct advantages, particularly when employing heterogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous Brønsted acid catalysts, such as zeolites, provide significant benefits over their homogeneous counterparts, including ease of separation from the reaction mixture, reusability, and reduced corrosion and environmental waste.

Zeolite-based catalysts, and specifically H-BEA zeolites, are highly regarded for their unique structural properties. H-BEA zeolites possess a three-dimensional pore structure with strong Brønsted acid sites, making them effective catalysts for a variety of acid-catalyzed reactions, including alkylation, isomerization, and acylation. The mechanism of Brønsted acid-catalyzed aldol condensation involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, which activates the carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack by an enol intermediate. The enol is formed through the acid-catalyzed tautomerization of another acetone molecule.

Previous studies have explored the use of various zeolite catalysts for acetone condensation. However, challenges remain, particularly concerning catalyst deactivation and selectivity control. Zeolites can be susceptible to deactivation due to the deposition of carbonaceous materials, or "coke," within their micropores, which blocks access to the active sites. Compared to Lewis acids and base catalysts, Brønsted acid zeolites can offer a unique balance of activity and selectivity, but their performance is highly dependent on the reaction conditions and the nature of the active sites.

#### **3. Molecular Environment and Solvent Effects in Liquid-Phase Catalysis**

A deeper understanding of molecular-level interactions within the confined spaces of catalyst pores is crucial for advancing liquid-phase catalysis. The solvent plays a critical role in modulating these interactions, influencing everything from catalyst-substrate binding to reaction kinetics and selectivity. The microporous environment of a zeolite can significantly affect the stability of reaction intermediates and transition states.

The choice of solvent, particularly its polarity, can have a profound impact on the catalytic process. For instance, the polarity of the solvent can influence the effective strength and accessibility of Brønsted acid sites within a zeolite. Water, as a polar protic solvent, can interact with the zeolite framework in complex ways. It can lead to the formation of hydronium ions, which may act as the active catalytic species, or it can hydrolyze framework bonds, potentially leading to catalyst deactivation. In some cases, water can even induce the formation of new Brønsted acid sites from Lewis acid sites. Conversely, a non-polar solvent like decalin creates a hydrophobic environment within the zeolite pores. This can influence the partitioning of reactants and products and alter the solvation of transition states, thereby affecting reaction rates and selectivity. The stabilization of transition states through specific solvation effects within the pores is a key factor in determining catalytic outcomes.

While the effects of solvents on catalytic reactions are broadly recognized, a significant knowledge gap exists in the detailed understanding of how different liquid-phase environments—specifically polar versus non-polar solvents—influence the molecular interactions within zeolite micropores during acetone condensation. This includes how the solvent affects the Brønsted acid sites of H-BEA zeolite, the solvation of reactants and intermediates, and ultimately, the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Addressing this gap is essential for the rational design of more efficient and selective catalytic processes for the valorization of acetone.

This manuscript, therefore, presents a comprehensive investigation into the self-aldol condensation of acetone in the liquid phase using an H-BEA zeolite catalyst. By systematically studying the reaction in both water (a polar, protic solvent) and decalin (a non-polar, aprotic solvent), we aim to elucidate the intricate interplay between the solvent, the catalyst, and the reacting species at the molecular level. Our findings will provide fundamental insights into controlling reaction pathways in confined spaces and will contribute to the development of improved heterogeneous catalytic systems for industrially important C-C bond-forming reactions.

# Introduction with References

The formation of carbon-carbon bonds through aldol condensation reactions represents one of the most fundamental and economically significant processes in organic synthesis and industrial chemistry. These reactions enable the transformation of simple carbonyl compounds into complex, higher-value chemical intermediates that serve as building blocks for a vast array of commercial products[1][2]. In particular, the self-aldol condensation of acetone produces valuable compounds including diacetone alcohol, mesityl oxide, isophorone, and mesitylene, which find extensive applications in the petrochemical industry, fine chemical synthesis, and pharmaceutical intermediate production[3][4]. The economic significance of these transformations is substantial, as they provide efficient pathways for converting abundant, low-cost feedstocks into specialized chemicals with enhanced molecular complexity and functionality[5]. Moreover, the development of selective and environmentally benign catalytic processes for C-C bond formation addresses growing industrial demands for sustainable chemical manufacturing, offering reduced waste generation and improved atom economy compared to traditional stoichiometric methods[6].

Despite the industrial importance of aldol condensation, achieving high selectivity and controlling product distribution remain significant challenges[7]. Traditional approaches often suffer from competing side reactions, catalyst deactivation, and limited control over reaction pathways, highlighting the need for improved catalytic systems and deeper mechanistic understanding[8][9]. Current research efforts focus on developing more efficient catalytic processes that can operate under mild conditions while maintaining high selectivity toward desired products[10].

The catalytic landscape for aldol condensation has evolved considerably since the early recognition that Brønsted acids could effectively promote these transformations. Historically, homogeneous acid catalysts dominated this field, but their inherent limitations including product separation difficulties, catalyst recovery challenges, and environmental concerns have driven the development of heterogeneous alternatives[11]. Among heterogeneous Brønsted acid catalysts, zeolites have emerged as particularly attractive materials due to their unique combination of well-defined pore structures, tunable acidity, and thermal stability[12][13]. The H-form of the Beta zeolite framework (H-BEA) has garnered special attention for aldol condensation reactions owing to its three-dimensional pore system with 12-membered ring channels and moderate acid strength that provides an optimal balance between activity and selectivity[14][15].

Recent studies have demonstrated that H-BEA zeolite serves as an effective catalyst for aldol condensation reactions, with researchers identifying it among the most promising zeolite catalysts alongside H-ZSM-5, H-FAU, and H-MOR for various condensation processes[16][17][18]. The mechanism of Brønsted acid-catalyzed aldol condensation involves protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, facilitating enolate formation and subsequent nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic carbon center[19][20]. The confined environment within zeolite micropores offers additional advantages by stabilizing reaction intermediates and influencing selectivity through shape-selective effects[21][22]. However, traditional zeolite-catalyzed systems face persistent challenges including catalyst deactivation through coke formation, limited control over product selectivity, and insufficient understanding of how the micropore environment influences reaction kinetics at the molecular level[23][24].

Previous investigations have shown that weak acid sites and a controlled number of active sites can favor selective aldol condensation reactions in zeolites, while recent work has highlighted the importance of understanding deactivation mechanisms caused by polymerized heavy compounds[25][26]. Compared to Lewis acid catalysts and base-catalyzed systems, Brønsted acid zeolites offer superior stability and recyclability, though optimizing their performance requires careful consideration of reaction conditions and molecular-level interactions within the pore structure[27][28].

A critical yet underexplored aspect of liquid-phase zeolite catalysis concerns the profound influence of solvent on catalyst performance and reaction mechanisms[29][30]. Understanding solvent effects on adsorption and protonation in porous catalysts remains a pressing challenge, as both pore diameter and solvent identity dramatically impact the confinement step and subsequent catalytic behavior[31][32]. The molecular environment within zeolite micropores is not merely a passive container for catalytic sites but rather an active participant that modulates catalyst-substrate interactions through complex solvation effects, competitive adsorption phenomena, and alterations in acid site accessibility[33][34].

The liquid phase environment significantly influences adsorption properties and reactivity of solid catalysts, with substantial performance changes observed as a function of solvent properties in various industrial processes[35][36]. In the context of zeolite catalysis, solvent polarity affects Brønsted acid strength through differential solvation of protons and conjugate base sites, while also influencing the extent of competitive adsorption between reactant and solvent molecules[37][38]. Recent advances have demonstrated the integral role of optimal solvent selection for catalytic upgrading processes in liquid phase, with zeolite confinement effects synergistically promoting reactant-acid site interactions compared to unconfined homogeneous systems[39][40].

The contrast between polar solvents such as water and non-polar solvents like decalin presents a particularly intriguing case for investigating solvent effects in zeolite catalysis[41]. Water, being a highly polar protic solvent, can participate in hydrogen bonding networks within zeolite pores, potentially altering the effective acidity and accessibility of Brønsted acid sites[42][43]. Conversely, non-polar solvents like decalin may provide hydrophobic microenvironments that favor organic reactant concentration within micropores while minimizing competitive solvation effects[44][45]. The active site environment in zeolite catalysts is multifaceted, composed of primary catalytic binding sites, secondary pore structures, and occluded solvent molecules that interact with adsorbed species, yet systematic studies exploring how different liquid-phase environments influence these interactions remain limited[46][47].

Current understanding of solvation effects on transition state stabilization, reactant preconcentration, and product desorption within zeolite micropores is insufficient for rational catalyst and process design[48]. This knowledge gap is particularly pronounced for self-aldol condensation reactions, where multiple reaction steps and intermediates must be accommodated within the constrained pore environment[49]. The interplay between solvent properties, pore confinement effects, and acid site characteristics represents a complex multivariable system that requires systematic investigation to unlock the full potential of liquid-phase zeolite catalysis[50][51].

This study addresses these fundamental questions by investigating the self-aldol condensation of acetone over H-BEA zeolite in contrasting solvent environments - water and decalin. By systematically examining how polar versus non-polar solvents influence the molecular environment within zeolite micropores, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms through which solvent selection can be used to manipulate catalyst performance and enhance reactivity. The research contributes to both fundamental understanding of liquid-phase catalytic processes in confined environments and practical applications in developing more efficient and selective catalytic systems for C-C bond formation reactions. Through detailed characterization of solvent-catalyst-substrate interactions, this work provides insights essential for rational design of next-generation liquid-phase catalytic processes.

Here is the manuscript introduction with the scientific references and the compiled reference list:

The formation of carbon-carbon bonds through aldol condensation reactions represents one of the most fundamental and economically significant processes in organic synthesis and industrial chemistry.1 These reactions enable the transformation of simple carbonyl compounds into complex, higher-value chemical intermediates that serve as building blocks for a vast array of commercial products.1 In particular, the self-aldol condensation of acetone produces valuable compounds including diacetone alcohol 3, mesityl oxide 3, isophorone 5, and mesitylene 6, which find extensive applications in the petrochemical industry, fine chemical synthesis, and pharmaceutical intermediate production.5 The economic significance of these transformations is substantial, as they provide efficient pathways for converting abundant, low-cost feedstocks into specialized chemicals with enhanced molecular complexity and functionality.5 Moreover, the development of selective and environmentally benign catalytic processes for C-C bond formation addresses growing industrial demands for sustainable chemical manufacturing, offering reduced waste generation and improved atom economy compared to traditional stoichiometric methods.7

Despite the industrial importance of aldol condensation, achieving high selectivity and controlling product distribution remain significant challenges.2 Traditional approaches often suffer from competing side reactions 3, catalyst deactivation 3, and limited control over reaction pathways 2, highlighting the need for improved catalytic systems and deeper mechanistic understanding.9 Current research efforts focus on developing more efficient catalytic processes that can operate under mild conditions while maintaining high selectivity toward desired products.

The catalytic landscape for aldol condensation has evolved considerably since the early recognition that Brønsted acids could effectively promote these transformations.10 Historically, homogeneous acid catalysts dominated this field, but their inherent limitations including product separation difficulties, catalyst recovery challenges, and environmental concerns have driven the development of heterogeneous alternatives.12 Among heterogeneous Brønsted acid catalysts, zeolites have emerged as particularly attractive materials due to their unique combination of well-defined pore structures, tunable acidity, and thermal stability.13 The H-form of the Beta zeolite framework (H-BEA) has garnered special attention for aldol condensation reactions owing to its three-dimensional pore system with 12-membered ring channels and moderate acid strength that provides an optimal balance between activity and selectivity.4

Recent studies have demonstrated that H-BEA zeolite serves as an effective catalyst for aldol condensation reactions, with researchers identifying it among the most promising zeolite catalysts alongside H-ZSM-5, H-FAU, and H-MOR for various condensation processes.2 The mechanism of Brønsted acid-catalyzed aldol condensation involves protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, facilitating enolate formation and subsequent nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic carbon center.17 The confined environment within zeolite micropores offers additional advantages by stabilizing reaction intermediates and influencing selectivity through shape-selective effects.13 However, traditional zeolite-catalyzed systems face persistent challenges including catalyst deactivation through coke formation 3, limited control over product selectivity 2, and insufficient understanding of how the micropore environment influences reaction kinetics at the molecular level.9

Previous investigations have shown that weak acid sites and a controlled number of active sites can favor selective aldol condensation reactions in zeolites 13, while recent work has highlighted the importance of understanding deactivation mechanisms caused by polymerized heavy compounds.3 Compared to Lewis acid catalysts and base-catalyzed systems, heterogeneous acid catalysts offer advantages in terms of recyclability and reduced equipment corrosion 12, though optimizing their performance requires careful consideration of reaction conditions and molecular-level interactions within the pore structure.

A critical yet underexplored aspect of liquid-phase zeolite catalysis concerns the profound influence of solvent on catalyst performance and reaction mechanisms.19 Understanding solvent effects on adsorption and protonation in porous catalysts remains a pressing challenge, as both pore diameter and solvent identity dramatically impact the confinement step and subsequent catalytic behavior.9 The molecular environment within zeolite micropores is not merely a passive container for catalytic sites but rather an active participant that modulates catalyst-substrate interactions through complex solvation effects, competitive adsorption phenomena, and alterations in acid site accessibility.20

The liquid phase environment significantly influences adsorption properties and reactivity of solid catalysts, with substantial performance changes observed as a function of solvent properties in various industrial processes.19 In the context of zeolite catalysis, solvent polarity affects Brønsted acid strength through differential solvation of protons and conjugate base sites 23, while also influencing the extent of competitive adsorption between reactant and solvent molecules.20 Recent advances have demonstrated the integral role of optimal solvent selection for catalytic upgrading processes in liquid phase 19, with zeolite confinement effects synergistically promoting reactant-acid site interactions compared to unconfined homogeneous systems.9

The contrast between polar solvents such as water and non-polar solvents like decalin presents a particularly intriguing case for investigating solvent effects in zeolite catalysis.9 Water, being a highly polar protic solvent, can participate in hydrogen bonding networks within zeolite pores, potentially altering the effective acidity and accessibility of Brønsted acid sites.25 Conversely, non-polar solvents like decalin may provide hydrophobic microenvironments that favor organic reactant concentration within micropores while minimizing competitive solvation effects.21 The active site environment in zeolite catalysts is multifaceted, composed of primary catalytic binding sites, secondary pore structures, and occluded solvent molecules that interact with adsorbed species 21, yet systematic studies exploring how different liquid-phase environments influence these interactions remain limited.9

Current understanding of solvation effects on transition state stabilization, reactant preconcentration, and product desorption within zeolite micropores is insufficient for rational catalyst and process design.9 This knowledge gap is particularly pronounced for self-aldol condensation reactions, where multiple reaction steps and intermediates must be accommodated within the constrained pore environment.3 The interplay between solvent properties, pore confinement effects, and acid site characteristics represents a complex multivariable system that requires systematic investigation to unlock the full potential of liquid-phase zeolite catalysis.

This study addresses these fundamental questions by investigating the self-aldol condensation of acetone over H-BEA zeolite in contrasting solvent environments - water and decalin. By systematically examining how polar versus non-polar solvents influence the molecular environment within zeolite micropores, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms through which solvent selection can be used to manipulate catalyst performance and enhance reactivity. The research contributes to both fundamental understanding of liquid-phase catalytic processes in confined environments and practical applications in developing more efficient and selective catalytic systems for C-C bond formation reactions. Through detailed characterization of solvent-catalyst-substrate interactions, this work provides insights essential for rational design of next-generation liquid-phase catalytic processes.
