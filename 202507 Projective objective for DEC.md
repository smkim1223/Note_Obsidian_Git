This project proposes the development of a scalable, carbon-utilization platform for the catalytic conversion of ethanol and carbon dioxide (CO₂) into high-value chemicals, diethyl carbonate (DEC). DEC is a critical chemical essential for a range of strategic U.S. industries, including lithium-ion battery manufacturing, solvents, and the coatings industry. Because both feedstocks ethanol and CO2 can be sourced from ethanol production facilities, this approach not only creates a logistical and economic advantage for co-located chemical plants but also drives increased demand for domestic bioethanol, directly supporting U.S. agriculture and rural economic development The market difference between ethanol ($0.25–$0.35/lb) and DEC ($12–15/lb) highlights the significant value-add potential of this process. Moreover, the ability to convert these low-cost, domestically available resources into a stable, high-demand product provides a new revenue stream for farmers and ethanol producers offering a strategic opportunity to reduce dependence on fuel markets and build resilience in the bioeconomy.
The global market size of diethyl carbonate (DEC) is projected to reach $0.6–1 billion by 2033, driven by its expanding utilization across key industries include its increasing application in battery electrolytes, pharmaceutical solvents, specialty chemicals, paints and coatings, and fuel additives (Figure 2). In particular, the lithium-ion battery sector is a significant contributor to market growth, fueled by the rapid expansion of electric vehicle (EV) adoption and the rising demand for high-performance energy storage systems. As global EV production scales and demand for advanced battery electrolytes grows, diethyl carbonate (DEC) is becoming increasingly vital to strategic sectors such as energy storage and low-carbon manufacturing. Establishing a domestic, bio-based DEC supply will not only reduce reliance on imports but also position the U.S. as a global leader and potential exporter in the clean energy materials market.
It is also important to highlight that despite the growing importance of DEC in various industrial sectors its production demand is significantly lower compared to the current needs for synthetic aviation fuel (SAF) and other biofuel markets in which bioethanol utilized heavily. With current U.S. ethanol production at approximately 18 billion gallons annually, the expected ethanol requirement for DEC production is only around 50 million gallons (0.05 billion gallons)—representing less than 3% of total ethanol production capacity. In contrast, the SAF production targets under the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge aim to achieve 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallon per year by 2035 requiring massive scaling of ethanol utilization as a key feedstock. These data illustrate that while DEC represents a niche yet valuable market, the ethanol demand driven by DEC production is comparatively negligible and unlikely to impact the broader biofuel industry or SAF production goals significantly.
In this project, we will integrate advanced heterogeneous catalysis to enable the coupling of CO₂ and ethanol, apply process intensification strategies to overcome equilibrium limitations caused by water formation, and conduct rigorous techno-economic and life-cycle assessments to establish a fully domestic, carbon-efficient pathway for diethyl carbonate (DEC) production. While we strategically target diethyl carbonate (DEC) as the primary product, developing coupling chemistry will also enable the production of dimethyl carbonate (DMC), another important battery electrolyte. DMC offers the advantage of being synthesized from biomethanol, which can be derived from waste feedstocks such as municipal solid waste (MSW) or lignocellulosic biomass through gasification. Our overarching goal is to establish a versatile platform for coupling chemistry that utilizes domestic feedstocks, paving the way for independence from foreign supply chain disruptions. The production of DEC or DMC is particularly critical, as both can undergo transesterification reactions (beyond the scope of this project) with methanol and ethanol to produce ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), which is another critical component in battery electrolyte formulations. Figure 3 shows the different linear polycarbonates that are used in battery industry and schematic of transesterification reaction to produce EMC. By advancing this innovative chemistry and leveraging U.S.-based resources, we aim to strengthen the domestic battery industry and unlock export opportunities, ensuring U.S. leadership in global energy storage technologies. 
The primary objective of this project is to develop a scalable heterogeneous catalytic system for the efficient production of diethyl carbonate (DEC) and to demonstrate its technological feasibility. To achieve this goal, the following objectives are outlined:
•	Design and Develop Active and Selective Catalysts: Create advanced heterogeneous catalysts capable of facilitating facile CO₂ activation and driving selective production of DEC with high efficiency.
•	Address Thermodynamic Limitations: Develop innovative catalytic and engineering strategies that overcome thermodynamic constraints and enhance DEC yield under practical reaction conditions.
•	Produce High-Purity DEC for Battery Applications: Ensure the development of a process that can produce DEC with sufficient purity to meet the stringent requirements for its use in battery electrolyte formulations.
