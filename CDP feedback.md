# Udishnu 2025
## Feedback will be sent directly to the line manager(s). To better inform the line manager, would you like to define your association to the person (e.g., peer, project manager, external feedback provider information, etc.)?
I work with him in the Basic Energy Science program at PCSD, so my association with him is as a project peer and collaborator within the same research program. In addition, Udishnu and I have discussed topics related to thermal and electrochemical catalysis for a couple of projects, further expanding our collaborative interactions in these research areas.

## Did they make a significant contribution, demonstrate leadership, or other behavior(s) that positively impacted the team, work/project, or collaboration?
He consistently brings valuable insights to discussions, in particular, electrocatalysis project in BES program. His leadership and proactive engagement with his technical expertise and collaborative approaches have positively impacted on our projects.

## Are there opportunities for improvement (e.g., related to their work, technical or behavioral competencies, collaboration, etc.)?
I also look forward to increasing his contributions to fundamental research works with high long-term potential. Strengthening this aspect would not only enhance the group’s research portfolio but also support his own professional growth in a meaningful way.



# Oceane
## Feedback will be sent directly to the line manager(s). To better inform the line manager, would you like to define your association to the person (e.g., peer, project manager, external feedback provider information, etc.)?
I have worked with Ocean since we collaborated on a proposal during the FY 2025 LDRD Team Building Workshop: Cross-Division Seed Call. Our proposal was successfully funded under LDRD 86088, _Virtual Intelligence System for Optimizing Novel Analytical Research Yields_. Together, we have been developing a hypothesis generation model aimed at advancing catalyst development, with her and I serving as Co-PIs, contributing domain expertise and data science, respectively. My professional relationship with her has been as a project peer and collaborator within the same research program.

## Did they make a significant contribution, demonstrate leadership, or other behavior(s) that positively impacted the team, work/project, or collaboration?
As the Principal Investigator, she has effectively led the project in the right direction and has managed it with a proactive and strategic approach. She consistently contributes valuable insights during discussions, particularly in bridging the gap between domain knowledge and data science. Her leadership, technical expertise, and collaborative mindset have had a positive and meaningful impact on the success of our project.

## Are there opportunities for improvement (e.g., related to their work, technical or behavioral competencies, collaboration, etc.)?
I also look forward to increasing his contributions to fundamental research works with high long-term potential. Strengthening this aspect would not only enhance the group’s research portfolio but also support his own professional growth in a meaningful way.
