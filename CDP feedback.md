# Udishnu 2025
## Feedback will be sent directly to the line manager(s). To better inform the line manager, would you like to define your association to the person (e.g., peer, project manager, external feedback provider information, etc.)?
I work with him in the Basic Energy Science program at PCSD, so my association with him is as a project peer and collaborator within the same research program. In addition, Udishnu and I have discussed topics related to thermal and electrochemical catalysis for a couple of projects, further expanding our collaborative interactions in these research areas.

## Did they make a significant contribution, demonstrate leadership, or other behavior(s) that positively impacted the team, work/project, or collaboration?
He consistently brings valuable insights to discussions, in particular, electrocatalysis project in BES program. His leadership and proactive engagement with his technical experties and collaborative approaches have positively impacted on our projects.

## Are there opportunities for improvement (e.g., related to their work, technical or behavioral competencies, collaboration, etc.)?
I also look forward to increasing his contributions to fundamental research works with high long-term potential. Strengthening this aspect would not only enhance the group’s research portfolio but also support his own professional growth in a meaningful way.
