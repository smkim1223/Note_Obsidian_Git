## Relative Mass

**Exam code:**9CHO

## Isotopic & Atomic Mass

- The relative mass of an atom uses the carbon-12 isotope as the international standard
- One atom of carbon-12 has an accepted mass of 1.992646538 x 10 <sup>-26</sup> kg
- It is not realistic to work with this value so the mass of a carbon-12 atom is fixed as exactly 12 atomic mass units / 12υ
- The standard mass for atomic mass is 1υ
	- Therefore, the standard mass for comparison is the mass of of a carbon-12 atom

#### Relative isotopic mass

- Relative isotopic mass is defined as the mass of an isotope relative to of a carbon-12 atom
- For A Level Chemistry it is common to work with mass values rounded to one decimal place, for example:
- The accurate relative isotopic mass of nitrogen is 14.00307401 but this is rounded to 14.0
- The accurate relative isotopic mass of oxygen is 15.99491464 but this is rounded to 16.0

#### Relative atomic mass

- Most elements on the Periodic Table represent a mixture of different isotopes, which is shown as their relative atomic mass (*A* <sub>r</sub>)
- The relative atomic mass is the weighted mean / average mass of an atom relative to of the mass of a carbon-12 atom

## Molecular & Formula Mass

- We have seen previously that the symbol for the relative atomic mass is *A* <sub><i>r</i></sub>
- This is calculated from the **mass number**  and  **relative abundances**  of all the  **isotopes** of a particular element
- The symbol for the **relative formula mass** is  ***M*** <sub><i><b>r</b></i></sub> and it refers to the **total mass** of the substance
	- The term relative formula mass should be used for compounds with giant structures e.g. ionic compounds such as sodium chloride
	- If the substance is molecular you can use the term **relative molecular mass**
- To calculate the *M* <sub><i>r</i></sub>  of a substance, you have to add up the  **relative atomic masses** of all the atoms present in the formula

It is expected that you will use relative atomic mass values from the Periodic Table

- This means that your values will be more accurate
- e.g. potassium carbonate = (2 x 39.1) + 12.0 + (3 x 16.0) = 138.2

If you are in any doubt whether to use relative molecular mass or relative formula mass, use the latter because it applies to all compounds whether they are ionic or covalent.
