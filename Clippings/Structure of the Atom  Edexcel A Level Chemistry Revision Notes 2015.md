## Structure of the Atom

**Exam code:**9CHO

## Structure of the Atom

- All matter is composed of **atoms**, which are the smallest parts of an element that can take place in **chemical reactions**
- Atoms are mostly made up of **empty** **space** around a very small, dense **nucleus** that contains **protons** and **neutrons**
- The nucleus has an overall **positive** **charge**
	- The protons have a positive charge and the neutrons have a neutral charge
- **Negatively** **charged** electrons are found in orbitals in the empty space around the nucleus

***The basic structure of an atom (not to scale)***

## Subatomic Mass & Charge

- **Subatomic** **particles** are the particles an element is made up of and include **protons**, **neutrons** and **electrons**
- These subatomic particles are so small that it is not possible to measure their masses and charges using **conventional** **units** (such as grams and coulombs)
- Instead, their masses and charges are compared to each other using **‘relative** **atomic** **masses’** and ‘ **relative atomic charges** ’
- These are not actual charges and masses but they are charges and masses of particles relative to each other
	- Protons and neutrons have a very similar mass so each is assigned a relative mass of 1 whereas electrons are 1836 times smaller than a proton and neutron
	- Protons are **positively** charged, electrons **negatively** charged and neutrons are **neutral**
- The relative mass and charge of the subatomic particles are:

The **relative** **mass** of an electron is **almost negligible.** The **charge** of a single **electron** is -1.602 x 10 <sup>-19</sup>   coulombs whereas the charge of a **proton** is +1.602 x 10 <sup>-19</sup> coulombs, however, relative to each other, their charges are -1 and +1 respectively.

## Atomic & Mass Numbers

- The **atomic number** (or **proton number**) is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom and has **symbol** ***Z***
	- The atomic number is equal to the number of electrons present in a **neutral** atom of an element
	- Eg. the atomic number of lithium is 3 which indicates that the neutral lithium atom has 3 protons and 3 electrons
- The **mass** **number** (or **nucleon** **number**) is the total number of **protons** and **neutrons** in the nucleus of an atom and has **symbol** ***A***
- The number of **neutrons** can be calculated by:

**Number of neutrons = mass number - atomic number**

- Protons and neutrons are also called **nucleons**
