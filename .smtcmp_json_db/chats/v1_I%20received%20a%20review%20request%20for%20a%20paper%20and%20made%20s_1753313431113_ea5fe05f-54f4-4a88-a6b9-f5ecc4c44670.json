Pathway control for polyolefin to naphtha: Physical mixing of Ru catalyst and zeolite enables selective hydrocracking over hydrogenolysis. Chem Catalysis\n\n#### Highlights and Key Findings\n- Physical mixing of Ru/TiO2 with BEA zeolite dramatically switches the reaction pathway from hydrogenolysis to selective hydrocracking for polyethylene (PE) upcycling.\n- This approach suppresses methane formation while achieving high naphtha yields under mild conditions.\n- Zeolite properties such as pore architecture and acidity are critical for enabling this pathway transformation.\n- Distinct roles of each component are elucidated by comprehensive mechanistic studies.\n- Ru characteristics (particle size, support effects) influence both monofunctional hydrogenolysis and bifunctional hydrocracking performance.\n- Physical mixtures are crucial for preventing excessive Ru-induced hydrogenolysis.\n- Ru serves as both a polyethylene deconstruction initiator and a (de)hydrogenation catalyst.\n- BEA zeolite executes selective C–C cleavage.\n- Ru oxide is reduced under 10% H2/N2 at 300 °C for 3 hours.\n\n#### Experimental Notes\n- 3.5 g of plastic feed was used in 25 mL Parr stainless steel reactors.\n- Reaction mixture was mechanically stirred at 600 rpm.\n- Questions raised about validation of mass transfer limitation at 600 rpm.\n- Inquiry about whether 300 °C under 10% H2 is sufficient to decompose RuCl3 or Ru(OH)3 into metallic Ru.\n\n#### Mechanistic Insights and Discussion Points\n- Effective pathway switching from hydrogenolysis to hydrocracking can be achieved even with substantially reduced Ru content, highlighting the intrinsic activity of Ru.\n- Monofunctional hydrogenolysis favors terminal C–C bond scission.\n- The role of (de)hydrogenation functions in bifunctional mixtures is critical.\n- Uncertainty about quantifying preference between terminal or central C–C cleavage in broad product distributions.\n- Different metals respond fundamentally differently when physically mixed with zeolites, influenced by metal–acid proximity.\n- Ru particles may be partially confined within zeolite micropores or on the external surface; evidence is inconclusive.\n- Diffusion dynamics from Ru surface to micropore are questioned.\n\n#### Catalytic Performance and Pathways\n- Hydrogenolysis pathway remains dominant with acidic small-pore zeolites (e.g., ZSM-5, FER, SSZ-13).\n- Naphtha yield decreases dramatically with certain conditions; isomer fraction and solid residue contents are affected.\n- Selectivity comparisons should be performed at comparable conversion levels.\n- C1–C4 fraction data poorly indicate methane formation; further clarification needed.\n- Insufficient hydrogenation of unsaturated intermediates suggests links to aromatization and olefin formation, potential precursors for catalyst coking.\n- Differences in diffusion and mass transfer limitations between C18 and PE explained partly by chain length and catalyst pore structure.\n- Hydrocracking is the dominant pathway from the onset with very low methane yields, despite expectations of random C–C cleavage creating methane.\n- Reaction parameters such as time, temperature, and H2 pressure impact hydrocracking with some threshold effects.\n- Skeletal rearrangements involving carbenium ions represent rate-limiting steps above 250 °C.\n- Maintaining adequate hydrogen availability is crucial to balance hydrogenation and cracking for selective naphtha production.\n- Extending reaction times or harsher conditions do not induce overcracking into light gases.\n- Hydrogen consumption after prolonged reaction may be linked to partial BEA catalyst deactivation.\n- Ru/TiO2 interactions intensify with increasing Ru particle size, affecting reducibility due to strong metal-support interaction (SMSI).\n- CO adsorption studies show characteristic bands associated with different Ru sites; intensity diminishes with particle size increase indicating TiOx encapsulation.\n- Contradictory interpretations exist about SMSI effects relative to particle size.\n\n#### Questions and Reviewer Notes\n- Evidence of the (de)hydrogenation functionality of the Ru catalyst in the physical mixture and how it changes at different reaction steps.\n- How Ru/TiO2 and BEA are involved in polyethylene conversion and descriptors for product distribution.\n- Validating the localization of Ru either inside micropores or on the external surface.\n- Impact of catalyst pore structure and acid site strength on product selectivity.\n- Observations of catalyst coke formation, especially on BEA.\n- Influence of polymer viscosity and possible mass transfer limitations at reaction temperature.\n- Clarity on whether observed hydrogen conversion rises conflict with proposed reaction pathways.\n- Suggestions to compare selectivity at comparable conversions and consider alternative explanations for kinetic data.\n- Clarifications on coke formation in Ru/TiO2 versus BEA catalysts.\n\n#### References to Figures, Tables, and Supplementary Data\n- Surface area and pore volume changes (Table S1).\n- Reaction time profiles and product distribution (Figure 4a, Figures S11, S15).\n- CO adsorption spectra characterization.\n\n#### Deadlines and Miscellaneous Notes\n- Deadline for review: August 2, 2025.\n</smtcmp_block>",

The study involves systematic investigation of zeolite properties, Ru catalyst characteristics, and catalytic mechanisms. The findings have potential significance for sustainable polymer recycling strategies.\n\n#### Major Concerns and Required Revisions\n- **Experimental Validation and Methodology**  \n  - Clarify and justify the reduction conditions used for Ru oxide (300 °C under 10% H2) to confirm full metallic Ru formation.  \n  - Provide data or references validating the stirring speed at 600 rpm effectively eliminates mass transfer limitations.  \n  - Address potential mass transfer and diffusion limitations in polymer conversion experiments, especially relating to PE viscosity and catalyst pore access.\n\n- **Mechanistic Interpretation**  \n  - Expand evidence clarifying the (de)hydrogenation functionality of Ru catalyst within the physical mixture and how this influences pathway switching.  \n  - Resolve ambiguity regarding Ru particle location—whether inside zeolite micropores or on external surfaces—and discuss implications for catalytic performance.  \n  - Provide quantitative or qualitative justification for preference between terminal versus central C–C cleavage, given broad product distributions.  \n  - Explain conflicting indications regarding metal–support interactions (SMSI) and Ru particle size effects on activity and CO adsorption.\n\n- **Catalyst Performance and Selectivity**  \n  - Ensure product selectivity comparisons are made at comparable polyethylene conversion levels to avoid misleading conclusions.  \n  - Clarify the role of zeolite acid site strength and pore size on hydrogenolysis versus hydrocracking dominance, particularly for small-pore acidic zeolites where hydrogenolysis remained dominant.  \n  - Discuss catalyst deactivation mechanisms, including coke formation on BEA and Ru/TiO2 components, supported by experimental evidence.  \n  - Address the unexpected observation of low methane yields despite anticipated random C–C cleavage in hydrogenolysis pathways.\n\n- **Data Presentation and Interpretation**  \n  - Include time-resolved data showing conversion, selectivity, and catalyst stability, especially regarding hydrogen consumption trends and possible deactivation over reaction time.  \n  - Remove or better justify any references to \"data not shown\"; all relevant data should be included or referenced clearly.  \n  - Improve clarity on CO adsorption spectral interpretation and reconcile contradictory observations about particle size and TiOx overlayer coverage.\n\n#### Minor Recommendations\n- Ensure all technical terms, symbols, and abbreviations are defined upon first appearance.  \n- Improve writing clarity in the introduction to establish the research novelty, target audience, and the significance of the work.  \n- Confirm that literature review adequately covers prior studies on polyolefin hydrocracking and hydrogenolysis selectivity.  \n- Carefully check formatting of figures, tables, and references for adherence to journal guidelines.\n\nThis manuscript presents valuable findings but requires substantial clarification and supplemental experimental evidence to support its conclusions fully. Addressing the points above will significantly enhance the manuscript’s rigor and clarity for publication consideration.\n\n#### Overall Recommendation: Major Revision\n</smtcmp_block>",
