However, clarification is needed on the evidence supporting the (de)hydrogenation functionality of Ru in the physical mixture, the nature of this function, and the specific reaction steps involved. How do Ru/TiO2 and BEA individually contribute to polyethylene conversion and the resulting product distribution? The descriptor for this behavior is not clear.\n- The role of Ru as a PE deconstruction initiator and as a protective (de)hydrogenation agent is noted, but the mechanisms behind these roles require further elaboration.\n- It is not fully resolved where Ru species reside—in micropores or on external surfaces of BEA—nor is there agreement on interpretation of reduced micropore volume data and particle size distribution. Additional characterization is urged to clarify Ru location and its influence on activity.\n\n#### Experimental Conditions and Validation\n- Reduction of Ru precursors at 300 °C under 10% H2/N2 is assumed to convert RuCl3 or Ru(OH)3 to metallic Ru, but this requires validation.\n- The authors report stirring the reaction mixture at 600 rpm; however, there is no discussion or validation on whether this rpm is sufficient to avoid mass transfer limitations.\n- The naphtha selectivity and other product selectivities should be compared at similar or comparable polyethylene conversion levels for a fair comparison.\n- The manuscript notes hydrogen consumption trends and catalyst deactivation by coke but does not provide clear correlation between BEA deactivation and hydrogen consumption, which largely depends on Ru/TiO2 activity. More insight into catalyst deactivation mechanisms is necessary.\n\n#### Product Distribution and Reaction Pathway Analysis\n- The claim that hydrocracking is the dominant pathway from the onset with low methane yields (<0.5%) seemingly conflicts with the possibility of stochastic or random C-C cleavage. Further explanation is needed.\n- The distinctions between terminal versus central C-C bond cleavage preferences in hydrogenolysis are mentioned, but quantification or qualitative justification of this selectivity based on product distribution is lacking.\n- Product distributions with other zeolites (ZSM-5, FER, SSZ-13) indicate dominance of hydrogenolysis despite the presence of",
