However, clarification is needed on the evidence supporting the (de)hydrogenation functionality of Ru in the physical mixture, the nature of this function, and the specific reaction steps involved. How do Ru/TiO2 and BEA individually contribute to polyethylene conversion and the resulting product distribution? The descriptor for this behavior is not clear.\n- The role of Ru as a PE deconstruction initiator and as a protective (de)hydrogenation agent is noted, but the mechanisms behind these roles require further elaboration.\n- It is not fully resolved where Ru species reside—in micropores or on external surfaces of BEA—nor is there agreement on interpretation of reduced micropore volume data and particle size distribution. Additional characterization is urged to clarify Ru location and its influence on activity.\n\n#### Experimental Conditions and Validation\n- Reduction of Ru precursors at 300 °C under 10% H2/N2 is assumed to convert RuCl3 or Ru(OH)3 to metallic Ru, but this requires validation.\n- The authors report stirring the reaction mixture at 600 rpm; however, there is no discussion or validation on whether this rpm is sufficient to avoid mass transfer limitations.\n- The naphtha selectivity and other product selectivities should be compared at similar or comparable polyethylene conversion levels for a fair comparison.\n- The manuscript notes hydrogen consumption trends and catalyst deactivation by coke but does not provide clear correlation between BEA deactivation and hydrogen consumption, which largely depends on Ru/TiO2 activity. More insight into catalyst deactivation mechanisms is necessary.\n\n#### Product Distribution and Reaction Pathway Analysis\n- The claim that hydrocracking is the dominant pathway from the onset with low methane yields (<0.5%) seemingly conflicts with the possibility of stochastic or random C-C cleavage. Further explanation is needed.\n- The distinctions between terminal versus central C-C bond cleavage preferences in hydrogenolysis are mentioned, but quantification or qualitative justification of this selectivity based on product distribution is lacking.\n- Product distributions with other zeolites (ZSM-5, FER, SSZ-13) indicate dominance of hydrogenolysis despite the presence of acid sites. The reason behind this — whether it involves acidity, pore size, or diffusional effects — should be discussed thoroughly.\n- The relationship between unsaturated olefin/aromatic species, possible aromatization, and catalyst coking, especially on BEA, requires further examination.\n\n#### Catalyst Characterization and Metal-Acid Interactions\n- Evidence of Strong Metal-Support Interaction (SMSI) effects is presented, including shifts in reduction peaks and CO adsorption bands with Ru particle size. The interpretation appears contradictory regarding particle size dependence on SMSI strength and overlayer coverage; clarification and supporting references are needed.\n- The decrease in surface area and pore volume upon Ru deposition suggests partial Ru incorporation or confinement within micropores, but this needs more definitive evidence and interpretation.\n- The spatial proximity of metal and acid sites and its effect on reaction pathways is a key aspect deserving more discussion.\n\n#### Reaction Parameters and Kinetics\n- Hydrocracking parameters including time, temperature, and hydrogen pressure influence activity. The existence of primary and secondary reaction products should be clarified, potentially by examining low polyethylene conversion data.\n- Activation energy (EA) results are reported, but attribution to specific catalyst components (BEA vs. Ru/TiO2) and relation to coke formation remains unclear.\n- The observed threshold effect on hydrocracking activity above 250 °C and effect of H2 pressure on maintaining hydrogenation balance require more mechanistic insight.\n\n#### Additional Suggestions and Questions\n- The authors should address and validate their experimental assumptions more robustly, including catalyst reduction, mass transfer limitations, and selectivity comparisons.\n- More detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies with varied reaction conditions could strengthen the claims of pathway control.\n- Expanded discussion on diffusion limitations, especially related to polyethylene viscosity, pore diffusion, and reactant/product transport, would enhance understanding.\n- Further information about catalyst stability over time and potential deactivation mechanisms would be valuable for practical applications.\n\nThese points aim to assist in improving the clarity, rigor, and depth of the manuscript to facilitate its contribution to the field of catalytic polymer upcycling.\n</smtcmp_block>",

The study is scientifically significant and has potential impact on sustainable plastic waste management. However, several key issues related to experimental validation, mechanistic interpretation, and catalyst characterization need to be addressed before publication.\n\n#### Key Points for Revision\n\n- **Reaction Mechanism and Catalyst Role:**\n  - The dual functionality of Ru in the bifunctional catalyst—transitioning from C-C cleavage to (de)hydrogenation roles—is not sufficiently clarified. The authors should provide a more detailed mechanistic explanation, including the relative contribution of Ru and BEA to polyethylene conversion.\n  - The exact location of Ru nanoparticles (within micropores vs. external surface) remains ambiguous. Additional characterization data are necessary to resolve this and link it to catalytic performance.\n  - The suppression of methane and dominance of hydrocracking require clearer evidence and discussion, especially given potential competing pathways.\n\n- **Experimental Design and Validation:**\n  - While reaction conditions (e.g., 600 rpm stirring) are reported, there is no validation ruling out mass transfer limitations, particularly considering polymer viscosity. Authors should support that observed kinetics are intrinsic.\n  - Comparisons of selectivity, especially naphtha yield and isomer fractions, should be made at comparable conversion levels to avoid misleading conclusions.\n  - The stability and deactivation behavior of the catalyst system, including contribution of Ru/TiO2 to coke formation, needs further clarification.\n\n- **Catalyst Characterization:**\n  - The evidence supporting strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) and its influence on Ru particle size and coverage is somewhat contradictory and requires clearer interpretation and literature support.\n  - Surface area and pore volume reductions upon Ru impregnation need more detailed explanation with respect to micropore volume changes.\n  - The proximity between metal and acid sites and its effect on the reaction pathway should be explicitly discussed.\n\n- **Kinetics and Reaction Conditions:**\n  - The observed threshold effect in PE conversion near 250 °C and related activation energy changes merit deeper kinetic analysis.\n  - The relationship between hydrogen pressure, catalyst hydrogenation balance, and product distribution should be explored further.\n\n#### Recommendations\nWith these clarifications and additional data, the manuscript would significantly strengthen its contribution to the understanding of pathway control in polyolefin upcycling. I encourage the authors to address these points comprehensively in a revised submission to enhance the rigor and impact of their work.\n\nThis review is provided to assist in evaluating the manuscript’s suitability for publication and to guide improvements to the study’s transparency, reproducibility, and mechanistic insights.\n\n</smtcmp_block>",
