## Adsorption measurement for aqueous-phase cyclohexanol on HBEA
The aqueous phase adsorption of cyclohexanol on HBEA was carried out by immersing 30–40 mg HBEA in an aqueous solution of cyclohexanol at a certain concentration and agitation (≈ 700 rpm) for at least 24 h. The zeolite was filtered from the liquid and the residual concentration of cyclohexanol in the filtrate was measured with Agilent 7890A GC equipping a flame ionization detector (FID) and HP-5 column (25 m of length and 0.25 µm i.d.) after extraction with dichloromethane. The quantification was done using 1,3-dimethoxy-benzene as an internal standard. The uptake was determined by the change in bulk concentration, volume of the solution and mass of the solid sample as following:

$$\begin{equation*}
Q = Q_{sat}\frac{K_{ads}^{\circ} [Cy-C_{6}OH]_{{aq}}}{1+{K_{ads}^{\circ} [Cy-C_{6}OH]_{{aq}}}} \tag{Eq. 1}
\end{equation*}$$

where _Q_ is the cyclohexanol uptake; _Q_sat is saturated uptake of cyclohexanol; (Cy-C6OH)aq is the equilibrium concentration of aqueous cyclohexanol; _K_°ads is the adsorption constant. The coverage of cyclohexanol (θ) can be expressed by the quotient of Q/Qsat (θ = Q/Q_sat).
