Prof. Dr. Kim and coworkers present a significant study titled “Pathway control for polyolefin to naphtha: Physical mixing of Ru catalyst and zeolite enables selective hydrocracking over hydrogenolysis”. This manuscript demonstrates a novel catalytic approach to effectively convert polyolefins into highly value-added fuels by physical mixing of Ru/TiO2 with BEA zeolite. This work describes a dramatic switch of the reaction pathway from hydrogenolysis to selective hydrocracking. This approach effectively suppresses methane formation (to less than 0.5%), while significantly achieving a high naphtha yield (~83%) under mild conditions (260-270°C, 3h, 50 bar H2). The work systematically investigates the crucial zeolite properties (pore architecture and acidity) and Ru characteristics (particle size, support effects) that enable to control the reaction pathway, providing valuable mechanistic insights. The catalyst system also demonstrates excellent reusability and versatility across various polyolefin feedstocks. Overall, the manuscript presents a highly impactful and well-designed study demonstrating a crucial pathway control strategy for polyolefin upcycling. The work is certainly a significant step towards more efficient and selective plastic waste management. Therefore, I would recommend this work for publication in _Chem Catalysis_, however, there are several points that require clarification, additional evidence, or further discussion to strengthen the conclusions and enhance the manuscript's impact.

1.       The authors provide details of the reaction conditions, specifying the mechanical stirring rate of 600 rpm in a 25 mL Parr stainless steel reactor. While this information is helpful, it is questioned to validate the absence of mass transfer limitations under these stirring conditions, particularly by considering the viscosity of the melted polymer at the reaction temperature.  So, the reliability of the observed reaction rates as intrinsic kinetic measurements may be compromised by the validation of the absence of mass transfer limitation.

2.       The discussion on the difference in catalytic activities for the physically mixed BEA and Ru/TiO2 for C18 conversion compared to PE (86% vs. 33%) emphasizes diffusion challenges associated with longer chain polymers. However, it also raises: (i) the viscosity of PE compared to C18 at the reaction temperature of 270°C and how it influences diffusion into BEA micropores; (ii) whether mass transfer limitations, specifically for PE, were systematically studied; (iii) the proposed hypothesis of initial cracking on Ru/TiO2 followed by diffusion into BEA pores, and whether alternative catalysts with open surfaces and minimal diffusion limitations were investigated to support this hypothesis.

3.       The discussion regarding Ru/BEA prepared by wet impregnation provides valuable insights into Ru deposition. The authors correlated the textural properties or Ru/BEA showed that reduced  surface area and pore volume of Ru/BEA compared to bare BEA, with Ru deposition in the pore specifically. However, HAADF-STEM images showed Ru can be incorporated within BEA micropore as well as on the surface. It would be helpful for the authors to explicitly state whether Ru nanoparticles are predominantly located within the micropores of BEA or primarily on its external surface. Besides, while the decreased total pore volume is highlighted as evidence of Ru presence in micropores, further clarification is needed on how this conclusion stands in the absence of a reported reduction in specific micropore volume.

4.       The manuscript presents the evolving role of Ru in the bifunctional catalytic system, transitioning from direct C-C cleavage in monofunctional Ru/TiO2 to (de)hydrogenation functions. The observation of yellowish liquid products at lower Ru/TiO2 ratios, linked to insufficient hydrogenation of unsaturated species, supported the (de)hydrogenation functionality of Ru. However, the potential contribution of Ru for C-C cleavage of PE conversion in the bifunctional system remains ambiguous. Tan et al. described the mitigation of diffusion limitation of PE into zeolite micropore via PE hydrocracking on the external acid site, followed by diffusion into micropore  (Appl. Catal. B, 338 (2023) 123028). In this regard, Ru-catalyzed C-C cleavage can be considered in prior to hydrocracking. Therefore, the authors are required to address whether C-C cleavage at Ru sites still plays a significant role, and if so, how this reconciles with the proposed switch in the reaction pathway. A more detailed mechanistic explanation of the interplay between Ru and BEA would help solidify the understanding of its dual functionality in PE conversion within the bifunctional system.

5.       The authors discuss the impact of BEA acidity (Si/Al2 ratio) on hydrocracking performance, highlighting trends such as decreased naphtha yield and isomer fraction, along with increased solid residue formation, as acidity decreases. While these observations are valuable for understanding the catalytic effects of acidity, it is crucial to ensure that the selectivity data are compared at the same or comparable conversion. Selectivity often varies with conversion, making direct comparisons across data obtained at different conversion levels potentially misleading.

6.       The reporting of C1-C4 yield in Figure 4b provides useful information regarding the overall production of light hydrocarbons; however, the inclusion of methane in the overall gas yield of C1-C4 can disguise the impact of monofunctional and bifunctional catalytic system on methane formation. Given the significance of methane in elucidating pathway control and reaction mechanisms, it would be more informative for the authors to explicitly report methane yield separately.

7.       The manuscript presents an interesting observation of a sharp, significant PE conversion to naphtha products, likely a threshold effect, at around 250°C and above temperature. The authors attribute this transition to enhanced skeletal rearrangement of carbenium ion intermediates at higher temperatures. While this explanation is plausible, a deeper investigation into the temperature dependence could provide valuable insights. Specifically, the authors are encouraged to discuss how the PE conversion rate and activation energy evolve around this temperature threshold and whether these changes suggest a fundamental shift in the reaction mechanism.

8.       The coke analysis offers important insights into the extent of coke formation, showing 7.8 wt.% for BEA alone and significantly reduced coke formation (1.3 wt.%) for the physical catalyst mixture. However, the contribution of Ru/TiO2 to coke formation remains unclear, as no data are presented for coke on Ru/TiO2 alone. The authors are encouraged to comment briefly on whether coke formation on Ru/TiO2 was negligible and, if so, why this component is less prone to forming coke compared to BEA. If coke does form on Ru/TiO2, quantifying or characterizing its formation would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the stability and deactivation mechanisms of the bifunctional system.

The observation that extending reaction times or applying harsher conditions did not lead to overcracking into light gases, coupled with the stability of C5-7 naphtha products, is impressive. The authors propose that this behavior prevents reversion to undesirable hydrogenolysis pathways. However, further clarification is needed to understand whether this trend implies that the secondary or sequential reactions occurring on Ru/TiO2 effectively terminate due to the absence of further beta-scission, especially from stabilized small C5-7 molecules. It is suggested that the authors elaborate on whether the stabilization of these intermediate products inherently limits the progression of excessive cracking or other catalytic pathways on Ru/TiO2. It would be also helpful to specify whether this termination is influenced by reaction kinetics, thermodynamic constraints, or the properties of Ru/TiO2 that selectively suppress undesirable pathways.
