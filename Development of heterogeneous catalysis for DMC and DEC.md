# (Prompt) Proposal for Federal Research Grant  
## **Title**: Development of Heterogeneous Catalysis and Processes for Dimethyl Carbonate (DMC) and Diethyl Carbonate (DEC) Synthesis  

### **Background and Significance**  
Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) are versatile chemicals used as eco-friendly solvents, lithium-ion battery electrolytes, fuel additives, and intermediates for polycarbonate production and green chemistry. Their synthesis contributes to reducing environmental impact by either utilizing CO2, a major greenhouse gas, or urea, a renewable nitrogen carrier, as feedstocks. This aligns with global efforts to achieve carbon neutrality and sustainable industrial practices. However, challenges remain in the efficient synthesis via (i) direct reaction of CO2 with alcohols (methanol or ethanol) and (ii) indirect pathways involving urea and alcohols.   

Achieving cost-effective, scalable, and environmentally sustainable DMC/DEC production requires innovation in heterogeneous catalysis to overcome thermodynamic limitations, optimize conversion rates, and improve selectivity, all while minimizing energy usage and byproduct generation.
